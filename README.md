A simple redirecter tool using express, deployed using Heroku. I host it at my website, kristianfreeman.com, so I can do simple memorable redirects to projects, social networks, etc.

All the data is hosted in routes.yaml so I can edit it on the fly from inside the GitHub UI instead of needing to double-check my work inside of a repo/command line.
